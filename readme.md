# Pacman Artificial Intelligence Project

<img src="./_github_example_pictures/preview.gif" width="45%" height="45%"/>

Project for the Artificial Intelligence course. The objective is to tackle diverse challenges presented in the Pacman universe, such as finding the shortest path, consuming all dots, and evading enemies. These tasks have been addressed through the utilization of different search algorithms like depth-first search, A*, and minmax.

## Course content

The purpose of this project is to further explore and solidify the concepts learned in the Artificial Intelligence course.

The course will cover the basic ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent machines. By the end of this course, you will have learned how to build autonomous (software) agents that efficiently make decisions in fully informed, partially observable and adversarial settings as well as how to optimize actions in uncertain sequential decision making environments to maximize expected reward.

Syllabus:
- Informed search
- Uninformed search
- Adversarial search
- Constraint Satisfaction Problems
- Local search and Optimization
- Markov Decision Processes
- Reinforcement Learning
